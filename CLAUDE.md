## Core Components

### 1. Game Engine (lov.py)

**Main Application Class**
```python
class LordApp(App):
    """Main LORD application with authentic BBS styling"""
```

**Screen Management**
- `WelcomeScreen`: Character selection and vault setup
- `TownSquareScreen`: Central hub with 18 authentic LORD options
- `ForestScreen`: Combat initiation and daily limits
- `CombatScreen`: Real-time battle system with AI integration
- `QuizScreen`: Knowledge-based combat interface

**Key Design Patterns**
- **Screen Stack**: Textual's navigation system for authentic BBS feel
- **Event-Driven**: Keyboard shortcuts match original LORD
- **State Management**: Global player state with screen isolation

### 2. Game Mechanics (game_data.py)

**Character System**
```python
@dataclass
class Character:
    name: str = ""
    level: int = 1
    hitpoints: int = 10
    max_hitpoints: int = 10
    # ... exact LORD stat progression
```

**Weapon/Armor Progression**
- **15 Weapon Tiers**: Stick (200g) → Death Sword (400M gold)
- **15 Armor Tiers**: Coat (200g) → Shimmering Armor (400M gold)
- **Exact LORD Pricing**: Maintains authentic economic progression

**Combat Formulas**
```python
def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender):
    # Exact LORD damage calculation
    base_damage = random.randint(1, attacker.attack_power)
    defense_reduction = defender.defense_power // 2
    return max(1, base_damage - defense_reduction)
```

### 3. Obsidian Integration (obsidian.py)

**Vault Detection Logic**
```python
class ObsidianVault:
    def find_vault(self) -> Optional[Path]:
        # Searches 15+ common locations including:
        # - Standard Obsidian folders
        # - iCloud sync locations
        # - Custom user directories
        # - Fallback to any folder with 3+ .md files
```

**Note Processing Pipeline**
1. **Scan**: Recursive .md file discovery
2. **Parse**: Extract title, content, tags, metadata
3. **Classify**: Age-based difficulty assignment
4. **Cache**: 5-minute memory cache for performance

**Enemy Generation**
```python
def get_enemy_for_level(self, level: int, notes: List[ObsidianNote] = None) -> Enemy:
    # Selects random note regardless of difficulty
    # Scales stats based on note age vs player level
    # Generates creative enemy names: "Mosquito of Machine Learning"
```

### 4. AI Integration (brainbot.py)

**Local AI Architecture**
```python
class LocalAIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None  # TinyLlama instance
        self.cache = {}    # 5-minute response cache
        self.available = False
```

**Background Initialization**
- **Threading**: AI loads without blocking game startup
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to regex if AI fails
- **Model Sharing**: Uses existing BrainBot model cache

**Quiz Generation Pipeline**
1. **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts for consistent output
2. **Response Parsing**: Regex extraction of Q/A/Type
3. **Validation**: Answer matching with semantic understanding
4. **Caching**: Prevents regeneration of identical content

## Combat System Deep Dive

### Traditional Combat Flow
```
Player Turn → Enemy Turn → Damage Calculation → Victory/Defeat Check
```

### Knowledge Combat Enhancement
```
Quiz Question → User Input → AI Validation → Critical Hit (2x) or Miss → Continue Combat
```

**Quiz Question Generation**
```python
def generate_quiz_question(self, note_title: str, note_content: str) -> QuizQuestion:
    prompt = f"""Based on this note about "{note_title}":
    {note_content[:500]}

    Generate a quiz question that tests understanding.

    Format:
    QUESTION: [your question]
    ANSWER: [short answer]
    TYPE: [definition/concept/fact]"""
```

**Answer Validation Logic**
```python
def validate_answer(self, user_answer: str, correct_answer: str, ai_question: bool) -> bool:
    # Exact match check
    if user_lower == correct_lower: return True

    # AI semantic matching (50% word overlap)
    if ai_question and word_overlap_ratio >= 0.5: return True

    # Fallback keyword matching
    return any(word in user_answer for word in correct_answer.split())
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Management
- **Note Caching**: 5-minute TTL prevents excessive file I/O
- **AI Response Caching**: Prevents redundant model inference
- **Lazy Loading**: AI model loads in background thread

### File System Efficiency
- **Vault Scanning**: Skips .icloud placeholders and templates
- **Recursive Globbing**: Uses pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
- **Stat Caching**: Reduces filesystem calls for large vaults

### AI Optimization
- **Model Selection**: TinyLlama 1.1B balances capability vs resource usage
- **Context Limiting**: Truncates note content to 500 chars for prompts
- **Thread Safety**: Background initialization with daemon threads

## Testing & Development

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Character creation completes successfully
- [ ] Obsidian vault detection finds user vault
- [ ] Forest enemies show note-based names
- [ ] Quiz attacks generate contextual questions
- [ ] AI gracefully falls back to regex when unavailable
- [ ] Combat math matches LORD formulas
- [ ] Save/load preserves all character data

### Development Environment Setup
```bash

python3 -c "from brainbot import sync_generate_quiz_question; q, a = sync_generate_quiz_question('Test Note', 'Machine learning is a method of data analysis.'); print(f'Q: {q}\\nA: {a}')"
```

## Known Technical Debt

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Global State**: `current_player` should be encapsulated
2. **Screen Coupling**: Some screens directly access game_db
3. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive exception management
4. **Type Hints**: Incomplete type annotation coverage

### Performance Concerns
1. **Large Vaults**: 10,000+ notes may slow vault scanning
2. **AI Latency**: First quiz question takes 2-3 seconds
3. **Memory Usage**: TinyLlama model requires ~1.5GB RAM
4. **File Watching**: No live vault updates (requires restart)

### Missing LORD Features (See TODO.md)
1. **Inn System**: Violet, Seth, bar room interactions
2. **Shop Mechanics**: Actual purchase transactions
3. **Banking**: Interest calculations and gold management
4. **PvP Combat**: Player vs player battle system
5. **Daily Events**: News, announcements, random encounters

## Security Considerations

### AI Safety
- **Local Processing**: No data leaves user's machine
- **Prompt Injection**: Limited by note content only
- **Model Safety**: TinyLlama has built-in safety training

### File System Access
- **Sandboxed**: Only reads Obsidian vaults and saves directory
- **No Execution**: Pure data processing, no code evaluation
- **User Control**: Vault path explicitly set by user

### Data Privacy
- **Local Storage**: SQLite database in saves/ directory
- **No Telemetry**: No analytics or usage tracking
- **Open Source**: All code visible and auditable

- **Response Caching**: 5-minute TTL prevents redundant generation
- **Graceful Fallback**: Regex patterns when AI unavailable
- **Background Initialization**: Non-blocking AI startup

### What Needs Enhancement ❌
- **Bland Enemy Names**: "Mosquito of My Themes Directory" lacks fantasy flair
- **No Combat Narrative**: Missing immersive battle descriptions
- **Limited Lore Integration**: Notes aren't woven into fantasy storylines
- **Static Quiz Format**: Questions feel disconnected from combat
- **Generic Enemy Generation**: No personality or backstory
- **Folder Structure Ignored**: Directory names not used for world-building

## 🎯 AI Enhancement Roadmap (v0.2.0)

### Phase 1: Dynamic Enemy Lore Generation
Transform generic encounters into rich fantasy experiences:

#### **Enhanced Enemy Names** (Priority: HIGH)
**Current**: "Mosquito of My Themes Directory"
**Target**: "Shadow Weaver, Keeper of Forgotten Themes"

```python
# AI-Generated Names Based on Note Content
- Technical notes → "Arcane Codex Guardian"
- Personal journals → "Memory Wraith"
- Project docs → "Blueprint Basilisk"
- Meeting notes → "Council Specter"
```

#### **Dynamic Backstory Generation** (Priority: HIGH)
Generate rich enemy lore using note metadata:
- **Content Analysis**: Extract key concepts from note text
- **Emotional Tone**: Derive personality from writing style
- **Age Mapping**: Ancient enemies for old notes, fresh threats for recent ones
- **Tag Integration**: Use note tags to determine enemy abilities

```python
# Example Generated Backstory
"The ancient Mosquito swarms around you, its wings buzzing with
forgotten knowledge of system architectures. Once a humble debugger's
companion, it absorbed years of late-night coding sessions and now
guards the sacred Directory Scrolls with fierce determination."
```

### Phase 2: Contextual Combat Narration
Transform combat from stat exchanges to immersive storytelling:

#### **Pre-Battle Narrative** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Generate why this enemy guards this specific knowledge
- Describe environmental details based on note folder structure
- Create tension with lore-appropriate enemy dialogue

#### **Mid-Combat Flavor Text** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Reference note concepts during attacks
- Generate enemy taunts related to note content
- Create spell-like effects for technical concepts

```python
# Example Combat Flow
Pre-Battle: "You enter the Crimson Archives, where forgotten bug
reports whisper in the shadows..."

Attack: "The Documentation Demon hurls a bolt of confused requirements!"

Critical Hit: "Your deep understanding of the codebase pierces
through its defensive obfuscation!"
```

### Phase 3: Knowledge-to-Fantasy Translation Layer
Convert any note content into magical fantasy concepts:

#### **Technical Translation** (Priority: HIGH)
- Code snippets → Arcane formulas and mystical runes
- Bullet points → Ancient scrolls with sacred markings
- Timestamps → Prophetic dates and celestial alignments
- File paths → Mystical locations and dimensional gates

#### **Concept Mapping** (Priority: MEDIUM)
```python
FANTASY_TRANSLATIONS = {
    "function": "ritual spell",
    "variable": "mystical essence",
    "database": "ancient tome",
    "API": "dimensional gateway",
    "bug": "curse",
    "feature": "enchantment",
    "commit": "chronicles entry"
}
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Quiz Integration
Transform learning into epic narrative moments:

#### **Riddle-Based Combat** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Frame quiz questions as enemy riddles
- Make correct answers unlock enemy weaknesses
- Generate lore-based explanations for all answers

#### **Adaptive Storytelling** (Priority: LOW)
- Track player knowledge patterns
- Generate personalized enemy dialogue
- Create recurring nemeses based on weak knowledge areas

### Phase 5: Note-Based World Building
Use vault structure to create living world regions:

#### **Dynamic Forest Regions** (Priority: LOW)
- Map note folders to forest regions
- Each region has unique enemy types and themes
- Generate region descriptions from folder names

```python
# Example Regions
"/Projects/WebDev/" → "The Silicon Swamplands"
"/Personal/Journal/" → "Whispering Memory Meadows"
"/Work/Meetings/" → "Council Chambers of Confusion"
```

#### **Living Encyclopedia System** (Priority: LOW)
- Enemies remember previous encounters
- Build relationships between related notes
- Create quest chains from linked/tagged notes

## Technical Architecture

### Enhanced Enemy Data Structure
```python
@dataclass
class EnhancedEnemy(Enemy):
    backstory: str = ""
    personality_traits: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    combat_phrases: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    defeat_message: str = ""
    victory_message: str = ""
    knowledge_domain: str = ""
    difficulty_flavor: str = ""
```

### AI Prompt Engineering
```python
def generate_enemy_lore(note: ObsidianNote) -> EnemyLore:
    """Generate rich fantasy lore from note content"""
    prompt = f"""
    Transform this knowledge into a fantasy enemy:

    Note: {note.title}
    Content: {note.content[:500]}
    Age: {note.age_days} days old
    Folder: {note.path.parent.name}

    Create:
    1. A mystical enemy name (not just "X of Y")
    2. Why it guards this knowledge (2-3 sentences)
    3. Its personality and motivations
    4. 3 combat phrases it speaks
    5. Victory/defeat messages

    Make it feel like an ancient guardian of sacred knowledge.
    """

## Recent Major Updates (September 2025)

### ✅ AI-Powered Dungeon Master Narratives (v0.0.2 - September 27, 2025)
**Problem**: Combat narratives were generic and didn't utilize note content effectively
**Solution**: Complete overhaul of AI narrative generation system

**Key Improvements**:
- **Simplified AI Prompts**: Focused TinyLlama on generating single rich narratives instead of structured fields
- **Enhanced Context**: Increased from 200 to 800+ characters of note content for AI processing
- **Structured Content Parsing**: Extract headers, lists, numbers, and bold items from notes
- **Content-Aware Generation**: AI incorporates specific note details into fantasy descriptions
- **Fallback Enhancement**: Rich fallback narratives when AI parsing fails

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
def _extract_structured_content(self, content: str) -> Dict[str, List]:
    """Extract headers, lists, numbers from note content"""
    # Parses markdown headers (# Title)
    # Extracts list items (-, *, +, 1.)
    # Finds numbers and bold items

prompt = f"""You are a dungeon master describing a magical encounter...
Title: "{note_title}"
Content: {enhanced_content}  # Now includes structured elements

Write a 3-4 sentence narrative incorporating specific details...
"""
```

**Results**:
- **Before**: "You discover the Sanctum of Eternal Knowledge..." (generic)
- **After**: "You enter the Algorithm Archive where 27 mystical patterns swirl... The ancient text declares 'Machine learning automates model building' as glowing runes..." (1600+ character rich narratives)

**Performance**:
- AI generates 1600+ character immersive descriptions
- Incorporates specific numbers, concepts, and text from notes
- Fallback system provides enhanced narratives when AI unavailable
- 800ms generation time for rich fantasy encounters

### ✅ Complete Setup Automation System
**Problem**: Users had to manually install dependencies via pip commands
**Solution**: Created comprehensive auto-setup infrastructure

**New Files Added**:
- **`setup.py`**: Auto-installs all dependencies, checks Python version, creates save directories
- **`run.sh`**: Mac/Linux launcher with first-time setup detection
- **`run.bat`**: Windows launcher with same functionality

**Features**:
- **One-Click Launch**: `./run.sh` or `run.bat` handles everything
- **Dependency Detection**: Auto-installs only when needed
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages and fallback options
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Mac, Linux, and Windows

### ✅ Input System Fixes
**Problems**: Multiple critical input handling issues
- Character selection screen completely broken (no keyboard/mouse response)
- Combat screen missing interactive interface
- AI initialization blocking startup

**Solutions Applied**:

#### **StartScreen Input Fix**
- Added `can_focus = True` for keyboard input capability
- Added `on_mount()` method with `self.focus()` for auto-focus
- Added clickable button fallbacks for all menu options
- Enhanced error handling with user notifications

#### **PlayerSelectScreen Complete Rewrite**
```python
# Before: Only handled "Q" key, no focus capability
class PlayerSelectScreen(Screen):
    def on_key(self, event):
        if event.key.upper() == "Q": ...

# After: Full input support
class PlayerSelectScreen(Screen):
    can_focus = True

    def on_mount(self) -> None:
        self.focus()
        self.notify("Character selection ready! Press number keys (1-5) or click")

    def on_key(self, event: events.Key) -> None:
        if key.isdigit():
            # Load character by number
        elif key.upper() == "Q":
            # Exit to main menu
```

#### **CombatScreen Interface Completion**
- Added missing combat button handlers (`_knowledge_attack`, `_show_stats`)
- Fixed NoMatches error for `#combat_status` element
- Added `_update_combat_display()` calls for UI synchronization
- Implemented quiz attack integration with AI

#### **AI Initialization Fix**
**Problem**: Incorrect async/await usage causing startup crashes
```python
# Before: Incorrect - asyncio.create_task() outside event loop
asyncio.create_task(initialize_ai())

# After: Proper threading for background initialization
import threading
ai_thread = threading.Thread(target=initialize_ai, daemon=True)
ai_thread.start()
```
